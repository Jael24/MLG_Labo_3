Travail pratique 3 du cours de Machine Learning (Speaker recognition using Neural Networks and Supervised Learning)

0. For each of the following experiments, provide a brief description of the number of
observations of each class, the features being used to train the model, the procedure
(explain) for selecting the final model (e.g., use the model_building.ipynb notebook), the
description of the final model and its evaluation (i.e., provide the cross-validation results,
the confusion matrix and the F-score). Comment your results.
1. Man vs Woman. Use only the natural voices of men and women to train a neural
network that recognizes the gender of the speaker.
2. Man vs Woman, using both natural and synthetic voices. Proceed as explained in 0.
3. Man vs. Woman vs. children. Proceed as explained in 0.
4. Design a final experiment of your choice (e.g., using your own voice). Proceed as
explained in 0.
